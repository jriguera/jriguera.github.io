Hello! I am a **platfom engineer** interested on **cloud platforms architecture**
and **DevOps principles**, focused on maximizing automation, finding out the balance 
between flexibility and security. The keys of the cloud platforms are scalability 
and resilience and I think by using modern frameworks based on microservices approach
will allow me to overcome the challenges, providing infrastructures oriented to services
and continuous delivery.

Fan of agile methodologies, passionate for quality, open source and free 
software, I am currently working for [Springer Nature](https://www.springer.com) helping 
out building in-house IaaS and PaaS solutions, bridging the gap between developers and operators.

This is the place to find some information about me, know more about my work, 
[read some articles about my thoughts](/blog). Feel free to [email me](mailto:jriguera@gmail.com) 
if you would like to get in touch or find me in the social media:
